help is in text below the main drawing area.
description of the standard usage plan.

click on one of the line drawing buttons
a popup textbox asks for the value. hit enter.
click on two points on the screen.
the value is grouped with the line and rendered on the
screen next to the line
each type of BC results in a different color line:
dark pink = displacement
black = traction
dark purple = crack traction
dark green = crack displacement

pressing compute should call the backend and grab an interior plot for each
ux, uy, sxx, syy, syx, szz
showing the field in the appropriate manner (quiver for displacement and
contour plot for stress.

add someway of linking to your results and showing someone else.

what are failure cases?

loading a file should show to geometry but not the solution plot
to get the solution again, compute should be performed again.
saving a file should only include the geometry, not the solution plot

compute should calculate all 6 fields. 

backend:
take in the lines and place an element every x lines
to do this, i need to implement the full SGBEM code.
I should use some general "Boundary Conditions" class in order to allow
things like zero boundary conditions that are not computed. This kind of structure
might be nice for having infinite bcs too?
in the distant future, an adaptive algorithm could be used to make this 
highly efficient.
